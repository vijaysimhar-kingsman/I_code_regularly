variable  size collection - in java we have <ArrayList> and LinkedLists

distinct collection -  in an array we should not have same /duplicates so
			for that we have SET's in java 

sorted collections - for sorted array we have SORTEDSET's in java

we also have INSERT , DELETE , SEARCH  functions which help user in should not 
bothering about how to arrange the data , insteda helps in focousing in 
handling the data

in java.util package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we have Collections
	-in collections we have 
	->list 
	->queue
	->set
main classes that need to be remembered 
 
1.add( E e ) # adding and object to the exitable classs
ex : c1.add(1)

2.addAll() # adds all the objects of a class

c1.addAll(c2)

3.remove(object o)


4.c1.removeAll(collection c2); # removes all the elements form c1 which are present in
			c2
5.c1.retainAll(c2) # this is conjugate to removeAll here c1 deletes all teh 
		objects which are not present in class c2

6.c1.equals(collection c2) 

7.clear() # empties the array or object

8.isEmpty() # returns true if the class has no objects

9. c1.contains(object o)

10.c2.containsAll(collection<E> c2)

11. c2.size()

12.iterator()

13 .toArray() it is used to convert list to array 




hashset is used when you have to implement adding and deliting elements with constant time.
HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<x,y>();
you can leave or else specify x: size of the hashset where as default size of the hashset is 16
you can leave or else specify y: the load function value by default its 0.75
